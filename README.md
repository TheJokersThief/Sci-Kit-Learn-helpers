# Sci-Kit-Learn-helpers
A bunch of functions to help do machine-learning using sci-kit learn

I originally developed these in preparation for a day-long Artificial Intelligence/Machine-Learning module in my fourth/final year of Computer Science.

I hope they can be of help to anyone looking to refine their sklearn workflow!
